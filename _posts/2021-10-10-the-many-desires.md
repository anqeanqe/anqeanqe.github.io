I want many things from my career. Framed another way, different parts of me have different desires related to my career. These desires often compete and, if acted upon, would pull me in different directions.

My workday is generally a comfortable five or six hours, between 10am and 5pm. The first two years at my current company, I took about fifteen days off; this year I'm aiming to nearly double that, as some of my colleagues have done. The work itself is challenging and interesting, and my peers are friendly, smart, and (mostly) driven. They trust me. I get paid a comfortable salary. I'm on a good health insurance plan through which I'm affordably tackling long-standing physical problems. In short, if I put my blinkers on, I like the day-to-day, and it could sustain me for... what seems like a long while.

Part of me wants this: the balance between the enjoyable intellectual challenge on the one hand, and the material, physical, and emotional comfort on the other.

My dad is retired now, but he worked roughly the same career that I'm currently in. He fell into it in his early 20s and worked until his early 60s. Based on his descriptions of his work-life, he was the kind of employee who buckled down and really dug into his work — because he liked it. Presumably for reasons similar to mine: the intellectual challenge, the fun of designing and building with enthusiastic, like-minded coworkers. It sounds like he didn't have much of a work-life balance — to the point that he made sacrifices to his relationships and his health — but that was by choice.

Part of me very much wants to avoid walking the same path my dad did, for reasons related to my ego and identity. Perhaps this amounts to teenage angst. This part of me is critical of (what I perceive to be) his flaws, and wants to prove that I am different and better than him, and to avoid making (what I perceive to be) mistakes that he has made.

I sometimes project what would happen if I allowed myself to follow in my dad's footsteps. If I didn't try to move against the grain; if I allowed the next thirty or forty years to play out as they currently are. I could feasibly double or triple my liquid income in the next five or ten years; I could become a millionaire. One day, I could live in one of those fancy glass-walled buildings with a doorman by one of the Manhattan rivers, and enjoy the sunrise or sunset view from my apartment, weather permitting. I could rise early, run by the water, sip premium-grade tea on my balcony or at a nearby cafe while reading a book, watching the financial center of the world wake up. I could unwind in the evening by walking along the pier, just as I did in high school during my habitual nightly study breaks. I could make myself feel important and valued by, like my dad, letting myself sink my teeth into my work. I could study and hustle and grind. I could enjoy the company of my colleagues — others who have surrendered to more or less the same lifestyle. I could make waves in the dating market based on the stability of my lifestyle, and based on my assets and job security.

Part of me wants this: the prospect of reliving my childhood nostalgia, as an adult who could actually afford what looked to childhood-me like the pinnacle of city life. The comfort, the feeling of self-importance, the feeling of having earned it. The feeling of actually being that wealthy-looking, seemingly happy adult, peacefully strolling around a residential neighborhood like I belong.

Of course, my work isn't something I would choose to do, of my own volition, if I had enough money to never work again. If I had enough money to never work again, I might spend my time volunteering for environmental or political causes, teaching high school math or science at a public school, making art and music, studying subjects on my own and in physical or virtual classrooms.

None of these pursuits is really possible if I don't have enough money. I could do all of these on the side, but I would have to make sacrifices: I wouldn't be able to fully devote myself to my job, nor to these more meaningful pursuits. If I fully devoted myself to the more meaningful pursuits, I likely wouldn't have the same comfort and stability that I would if I committed myself to my job.

Part of me wants to sacrifice the material comfort and the emotional stability that comes with it, and instead pursue these activities that I think would feel more fulfilling. To minimize the amount of regret I'll have when I'm older and reflecting on my career, to maximize the impact I have to causes I care about, and fundamentally to be true to myself in the way that ancient Greek philosophers would be proud of.

Part of me thinks I won't be able to effectively do the meaningful pursuits, or be totally happy or healthy while doing them, if I don't have the material comfort and stability, or if I try to focus on both the 9-to-5 and the fulfilling stuff at the same time — and thus that it's better to pursue them in cycles, or to front-load the day job so that I can save up enough to later entirely devote myself to those other projects.

Another part of me worries that this kind of front-loading will consume too much of my life and I'll regret it — in particular, that it will consume too much of the youthful, energetic part of my life. Or, that I'll grow too cozy with the day job, and abandon the dream.

Part of me wants to try to convince my gut that my career is actually cool and fulfilling. It wants to read the industry classics — the biographies and memoirs and novels — and to drink the company Kool-Aid.

Part of me thinks that no matter what I choose, the prospect of the "grass is greener" syndrome will always be there, and that I must make peace with whatever I choose by adjusting my mindset rather than by adjusting the content of what I'm doing (so long as the content meets my bare minimum requirements).

Part of me thinks about regret minimization, and is skeptical of the narrative that most old people regret working too much; there must be some who are grateful they honed their craft, had a consistent focus, leveled up, were rewarded socially and materially and spiritually for it — even if their work was within a capitalist system and they didn't really choose it themselves, but more or less fell into it as an accident of circumstance; and even if they made significant sacrifices for their work. Look at the chef Jiro Ono, and the animator Hayao Miyazaki.

Part of me thinks there's no truly spiritually satisfying path and thus that I might as well embrace some amount of hedonism and just try to have cushy short-term experiences — and another part of me says that this won't last and that I must have some pursuits that are deeper and longer-term.

Part of me thinks that the answer is to experiment. To try fully devoting myself to my current company for a while. To try working a lot less and filling my free time with more fulfilling activities (emotional and mental health permitting). To take a sabbatical and devote myself entirely to the more fulfilling activities. To try making my own product or my own company. To cycle through all of these — and others — for the rest of my life.

No matter what, I cannot stop asking these questions and examining my decisions. And I don't think I can simply put my blinkers on and coast forever; to do so would be to cheat myself of a fully examined and fully dignified life. Past experience has taught me that while routine is good, occasionally breaking the mold and living outside of my past norms is also good. I suspect that I must integrate both to live a truly satisfying life, and that doing so will require balancing these different selves' competing desires.
