title:  "Social Status"

Over the past few months I've thought a lot about my motives and anxieties, and I've
realized that much of what I choose to do and to care about is based on how I think
it will affect my social status in the eyes of my peers.  Before this recent phase
of self-exploration, I don't know if I would have wanted to admit this --
I think I wanted to believe that I was motivated purely by the activities themselves.
But now that I've tried looking at a bunch of my wants and my habits through this
lens, it seems so obviously right:  I'm just a monkey, and pleasant chemicals are
released in my brain when other monkeys clap for me.

The main reasons I majored in math are that in high school, I had been praised by my classmates and teachers for
being good at it, and I wanted to keep receiving praise;  I knew that other people
thought that math was hard, and that people who were "good" at math (relative to others?)
were "smart", and this was my main source of esteem and worth in high school;  I had
no experience with looking for jobs, but I had heard that math was one of the best
majors you could choose if you wanted to maximize your salary, and high salaries are
typically associated with prestigious jobs that are difficult to land, and therefore
with high social status.  I've definitely had moments where I'm so immersed in a math
problem that I'm just enjoying it for its own sake, but now that I'm out of school and
my job doesn't require it, I never do math for its own sake.  If I _really_ enjoyed math
for the pleasure of doing math, and not for the external validation, I'd probably still
do it.  I'm pretty sure that the long-term motives, and a lot of the "yum" that I
trained myself to associate with it, came from the external validation.

Math is just one example.  Maybe this sounds toxic, but again: it feels so obviously true.
I can't deny that these external motives feel strong.  They're not necessarily stronger than
others, and they're not always there, but they are a lot of the time.  Here's another
more recent example.

Many of my friends talk a lot about books and long-form magazine articles they've recently read.
This has made me feel that I should also read books and long-form articles and talk about them
with my friends.  Why?  Because reading and being able to talk eloquently and in detail about
what I've read is a sign of intelligence.  My friends must be intelligent, and maybe if they
think I'm not intelligent, they won't want to spend time with me.  Maybe they'll stop being
my friends, and I'll be prohibited from The Smart People Friend Group, and I'll gradually lose
the social status symbols I currently have -- in this case, starting with my network, but maybe
leading to my job and lifetime earning potential.  I really want to be accepted by my friends, and my monkey brain
worries that they won't accept me if I don't show them that I'm capable of doing the same
activities they do, even if to me they feel more like "jumping through hoops" and less like
fun.  Worse, my moneky brain worries that they won't accept me if I don't show them that I'm
not also continually doing those things -- it's not concerned with just capability.  Of course
I _know_ that I can read a book, take a ton of notes, and talk about it in an entertaining
way to my friends.  Keeping it up is a different matter.

I'm not saying that these justifcations are reasonable.  There's a lot to question here.
Would they _really_ stop being my friends if I didn't bring up books I've recently read
as often as they do?  If so, are those the sorts of people I actually want to be friends with?

I have actually "lost" "friends" in the past because (as I see it) they thought I wasn't worth
their time.  But looking back on each of those "friendships", I don't think I'd want to
be their friend now.  Simply put, these people were not "chill", at least in my interactions with them.  I didn't
feel relaxed around them and I regularly felt judged.  I wondered if they had their own
complexes around needing to do things that made them feel smart and respected.  Of course
there's no way for me to know their actual thoughts and feelings, but ultimately their behavior,
and how it made me feel, matter more.

And, the people who I like, who often talk about what they read -- we're still friends, even
though I don't always talk about what I read as often as they do.  Unless our life
situations drastically change, I honestly don't see why we'd stop being friends.  I don't feel
completely socially satisfied, but I do feel like I receive a lot of what I want out of my
social life from the friends I already have and the things we do together.

My monkey brain doesn't think these thoughts, though -- it just recites, "do impressive
things; otherwise, lose friends and social status."

Why does all of this matter?  Often, when I follow my monkey brain without questioning its
conclusions, and pick up some activity that I normally wouldn't do, or that I might normally
do, but for reasons different from the monkey brain's, then I end up unhappy while _doing_
the activity.  The monkey brain doesn't want to _do_ the thing; it just wants the friendship
and the social status that it thinks will result from doing it.  This internal conflict often
frustrates my efforts to please the monkey brain:
I don't enjoy doing the thing (at least, not when motivated by the monkey brain's reasons),
so I stop doing it, but then the monkey brain's alarms go off and make me feel that my
social status is at even greater jeopardy, so then I pressure myself further into doing the
activity, but again don't enjoy it (especially not with the ever-increasing stress!), and
so on.  And of course, while feeling this self-imposed pressure in the moment, it's hard to take
a step back, "logically" think through all of this, examine my motives, and align what
I'm doing with my motives.  It's hard to break the cycle.

I'm not saying that social status isn't valuable, or that it's not a useful or "good"
motive.  I just don't want it to always be my guiding motive, or if I do, I want to be
very clear with myself that it is, or I at least want the activity I end up doing because of it
to be enjoyable and fulfilling.  I'm tempted to say something like, I want to be able to
pursue whatever I want without concern about how it will affect my social status.  I'm
unsure that's totally true, or even possible -- I am, after all, a monkey.  But I think
it's realistic to regularly evaluate how I'm spending my time by asking myself why I'm
doing the activity, and whether I'm enjoying it or finding it fulfilling.  If not, and the "why" has something to do with
fantasies about social status, maybe it's worth going through the exercise of questioning
it.

Maybe my monkey brain just needs to know that _something_ I'm doing
will positively affect my social status; maybe it doesn't require _every_ activity to
do so.  I could look at all of my habits and ask myself why I'm doing them.  I could
be explicit about why exactly each habit motives me; for example, Aspect 1 of Activity X appeals to me because I enjoy it, but Aspect 2 of Activity X appeals to me because I think it'll boost my social status.
But if I'd enjoy Activity X more if I weren't socially motivated by Aspect 2, and I'd be
okay instead being socially motivated by Aspect 5 of Activity Y, then is it possible to
change the monkey brain's expectations so that it expects this kind of social fulfillment
from Activity Y instead of from Activity X, without necessarily changing how I do each
activity, or how others see them?  I'm unsure.

Another possibility is to pick up new activities explicitly to satisfy the monkey brain's
cravings for social status, and to hopefully make it okay with not expecting an increase
in social status from existing activities (from which it currenty expects an increase in
social status).  But again, I'm unsure if this "expectation redirection" is possible.

Maybe it's unnecessary to be so methodical; maybe just regularly examining the motives of my existing
activities and being aware of the underlying social status goals is enough to make them
less subconsciously clingy.  This regular examination can occur whenever I feel the
internal conflict of not enjoying an activity, but feeling like I want an increase in
social status from doing it.

I don't have a proven solution for resolving these internal conflicts, but in my experience,
awareness does help a bit.  I hope to share my progress as I continue experimenting and
digging into my thoughts and feelings.
