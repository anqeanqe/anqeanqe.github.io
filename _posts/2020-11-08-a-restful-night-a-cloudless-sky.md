title:  "A Restul Night, A Cloudless Sky"

A week of overcast skies and rain.  A week of rough sleep for no obvious reason -- no work stress, no friendship drama, normal daytime and evening routines.  Maybe it's partly that the super just turned on the building heat so my body is adjusting to the new nocturnal temperatures.  Or it could be partly due to my makeshift floor-bed: four layers of blankets that get slightly displaced and less evenly folded each night, and a brick of a pillow.  In any case, for whatever combination of arbitrary reasons, not a great week's worth of sleep, nor a great week's worth of weather.

My bedtime has lately been around midnight, and my usual wake time around 8:30.  (Maybe my gradually latening bedtime is another reason my sleep quality has worsened.)  Yesterday I was tired and had a worrisome neck-and-eye ache, so I went to bed early, around 9:30.  Sleep came after half an hour, and as usual, I rose two or three times throughout the night to use the bathrooom.

Wake up; pull off the eye-mask; see sunlight streaming in through the window.  It must be 7 or 7:30 -- relatively early.  The aches are gone, and there's a pleasant feeling of refreshment and energy.  Rise, dress, go through the usual morning hygiene routine.  Look in the mirror, take a deep breath, smile.  Lace up and head out.

Sunlight, for the first time in a week.  The sky is cloudless and the air is comfortably crisp; a soft breeze  rustles and scatters the leaves.  It's mid-autumn, and the greens and oranges and browns look much more alive than they did when the only light they got was filtered through heavy clouds.

Chin up, shoulders back, chest out, squeeze the glutes, rotate the hips forward and up.  Let the arms swing as they may.  Feel the slight swagger.  More deep, easy breaths.  Body's rested and at ease, mind's as clear as the sky.

What a difference a restful sleep and a sunny early morning walk can make.  Compared with the previous week, I felt like I could do anything.  The rest of the morning went well, though the afternoon and evening felt more or less normal.

Of course, it's fleeting.  The rest of the week was sunny, and the early morning walks were pleasant, but they just didn't feel the same as the first day's.

Oh, is there anything one can do to experience this every day?  How does one even search for others' experiences of and reflections on these feelings?  Do we even know what words to use to describe these feelings?

Maybe there's hope.  We can gently nudge our behaviors toward those that, for me, coincided with the feeling: deepen our sleep; get up earlier; take more deep breaths; improve our posture; pause and appreciate the day, no matter what it brings.  Maybe then the feeling will come, or at least present itself more often.

Or not.  Who knows?  The only way to find out is to try.  And the only way see what others think is to talk about it.

Okay, I'm done waxing poetic for now; time to come down and return to the everyday...
