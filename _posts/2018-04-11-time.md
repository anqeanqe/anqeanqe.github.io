Don't let other people waste your time. Don't let yourself waste your time. Your time is all you have. You need to respect yourself more. Be firm; if others are offended or they don't understand, they're not worth spending time with.

Don't idolize anyone; be careful of the halo effect. Someone's photo reel -- whether in person or digital -- is not a representative sample of their life.
