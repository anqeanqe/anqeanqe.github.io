Maybe it will be useful later on to remember what my symptom progression has
been like, so I am recording it here in the fullest detail I can recall.

Around March 9, I started experiencing mild cold symptoms: congestion, head
ache, neck ache.  Slightly annoying but nothing that prevented me from
going to work, seeing friends, and going to the gym.  No changes in appetite,
sleep, etc.  I hadn't yet started measuring my temperature.  I hadn't yet
started social distancing.  (I regret not telling friends about these symptoms,
but to my knowledge, no one I interacted with during this period has become
sick.)

On March 13 I started working from home, per company policy.  My symptoms
persisted with no noticeable change.

On the evening of March 23 my symptoms suddenly took a turn for the worse:
I had a fever, aches, and chills.  I slept ten or eleven hours that night,
and the next morning I stayed in bed until noon.  I made myself soup,
rested on the living room futon for the afternoon, and went to sleep around 10.
Generally my symptoms felt worse during the evening and night than
during the day.  This continued through March 27.  March 28 was the first
day I felt well enough to keep a relatively normal (albeit sedentary)
schedule.  I took my temperature only once from 03/23 - 03/28 and measured
99.6; presumably this was in the evening, when I subjectively felt more
feverish.

From 03/23 - 03/28 I also experienced some chest pain and shortness of breath
at night.  The chest pain and shortness of breath were exacerbated by lying
on my back: if I got up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night and
had been sleeping on my back, I would feel the need to take a deep breath
before hoisting myself out of bed.  (I should note that I'm uncertain the chest
pain is due to this illness, because sleeping on my back had been giving me
shoulder and back pain well before I'd experienced any symptoms, and I'd never
paid much attention to exactly where the pain was concentrated or how
severe it was.  After all, I was just getting up to use the bathroom in the
middle of the night.)

I also had less of an appetite than usual.  Some days I would not eat until
1 or 2 pm, and only then because I felt I ought to replenish my body's stock of
nutrients, not because I craved food or felt hungry.  Notably, I was still
able to taste and smell, and I haven't noticed not being able to taste or
smell at any point.  (This is notable particularly because my subjective sense
of smell has for most of my adult life been less pronounced than my friends'.)

Since 03/28 I've felt well enough during the day to work, do push ups and
pull ups and squats, walk and run outside, etc.  I've taken my temperature
every few days, mostly when I subjectively feel warmer than normal, and I've
measured anywhere between 96.8 and ~98.  (I use a cheap thermometer I picked
up at a drug store a few months ago.)

After 03/28 I had assumed, based on video calls with nurses, conversations
with people who seem to know more about COVID-19 than I do, and cursory Internet
research, that I had gotten the virus and recovered.  It's entirely possible
that I coincidentally contracted a different illness, but many factors bias
my confidence in favor of COVID-19: I live in an area with an outbreak, I spent
a lot of time outside and near other people prior to March 23, my symptoms
are a subset of the typical coronavirus symptoms, the timing...  Also, this is
the first time I've ever experienced chest pain and shortness of breath from
an illness, and these are typical coronavirus symptoms.

For the first week or so after 03/28 I thought I had completely recovered and
wouldn't experience any more symptoms.  (I realized I should still be careful,
so as to not contract the virus in case my first illness was not coronavirus,
and to not infect others.)  But I occasionally notice much less severe versions
of the same symptoms I had from 03/23 - 03/28: feeling slightly warmer than
usual, slight goosebumps / chills, some neck pain and fatigue.  Again, these
symptoms have been more noticeable at night than during the day.

Since 04/17 or 04/18, I've noticed a slight uptick in the severity of the
feverish and goosebump feelings, I've felt slightly more tired during the
day, and I've been going to sleep earlier.  And I've noticed more shortness
of breath and chest pain in the middle of the night.  (Last night, after
returning to bed from getting up to use the bathroom, I felt I had to
carefully control my breathing, and deliberately breathe slow, deep, breaths,
to ensure I would be comfortable enough to fall asleep again.)  My temperature
since 04/17 has been between 97 and 98.

(April 12 - April 17 was more stressful than usual because of a project at
work, and I am prone to work stress affecting other parts of my life, e.g.,
my sleep, so I wouldn't be surprised if the stress and excess hours impaired
my immune system that week.)

This general symptom progression -- mild cold symptoms, a few days of severe
symptoms and rest, then a return to almost-normal with lingering symptoms --
is, according to the same sources who gave me confidence I might have (had)
COVID-19, not unusual for COVID-19.  In general, it seems that the symptoms are
not confined to the standard "linearly worsen, then linearly improve" pattern
-- they may come and go in waves, and last for anywhere between two and six weeks.
(Of course, some people experience symptoms so severe they require hospitalization,
and others experience no symptoms.  The range of symptoms is wide, and my
progression seems to be not atypical.)

Today I got a PCR test for the virus, and I'll find out in a few days whether
I had it at the time I was tested.  The test isn't perfect -- it permits false
negatives and false positives, it doesn't indicate if I've had and recovered
from the virus if I no longer have it, and it doesn't tell me how long my
symptoms or contagiousness will persist if I do have it.  The nurse who
administered my test said that the provider will hopefully be able to provide
serology tests within a month, which would at least be able to tell me if
I had and recovered from the virus if I no longer have it.

Other things to note:
- "Mild."  I initially didn't care about getting infected since I'm not
  in a high-risk demographic and since I don't regularly interact with
  people in high-risk demographics.  I had read that the symptoms felt by
  people in my demographic are in the vast majority of cases "mild" and
  sometimes unnoticeable.  What I hadn't considered is that "mild" can mean
  anything short of "needs to go to the hospital".  The five days I spent
  resting was very unpleasant and I wish I could have lived that week normally.
  The lingering symptoms since then, and the uncertainty around how long
  they will last, what illness(es) I've actually had, etc. have made the
  past few weeks less productive and enjoyable than they would otherwise be.
  In retrospect I wish I had been more cautious and avoided this whole
  experience.
- "The smell."  I don't know how to describe it, but the air has smelled
  different since the five days I spent in bed.  At first I dismissed it
  as "sick breath" -- the phlegmy sort of smell you notice in your mouth
  when you wake up, before you've brushed your teeth, while you have a cold.
  But the "sick breath" has since gone away and been replaced by a...  Again,
  I don't know how to describe it.  It could just be the smell of the spring
  air.  I wonder if anyone else has noticed this -- whether it's just that
  spring smells different this year, or that its smell is the same as it is
  every year but just more noticeable now since I've been spending less time
  outside, or that this smell is actually an artifact of the virus.
- "The tank."  Often when I notice a strong primal, physical urge to take
  care of myself, I'll tell myself, "Alight, time to stop what I'm doing and
  take care of the tank."  This small change to my internal monologue makes
  me feel more okay about focusing on whatever it is that my body needs
  (sleeping, resting, eating) and not doing the things I'd normally like to
  do (read, exercise, see friends...).  After all, my tank needs to have
  enough fuel, be well-rested, etc. in order for me to meaningfully engage
  with my interests or hobbies.

That's all for now.  I may post updates in the coming weeks as things change.
