Let's start with some Maslow-inspired principles, in no order of significance:

- Acknowledge your humanity; i.e., if something feels off, consult this list.
- Exercise a moderate amount every day.
- Sleep enough every day.
- Eat well and in moderation; do not overeat or indulge in unnatural foods or drinks.
- Do not use drugs; use only small amounts of caffeine from tea.
- Spend time outside every day.
- Spend time with others; meet new people and nurture important relationships.
- Give your time and attention; be part of something beyond yourself.

I wish to live by these principles every day.

There are occasionally days which, for whatever reason -- often failing to plan -- lack actions from one or more of these categories. On such days I wish to notice the off-balance feeling, refer to the first principle, and fix the error.
