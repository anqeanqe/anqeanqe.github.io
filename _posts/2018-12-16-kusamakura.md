I recently finished reading "Kusamakura" by Natsume Soseki. Here's what I'd like
to remember about it.

The story is about an unnamed artist on a walking journey through some
mountains. He's a painter and a poet, although he ends up only writing poetry
and not painting on his trip. He seems to be taking a break from his everyday
life so he can spend his time doing art and appreciating nature. His regular
life and profession aren't addressed.

The book focuses on his stay at a guesthouse in the mountains, owned by a
family of at least a father, son, and daughter. The daughter, Nami (whose name
means "beauty"), is a mysterious character, and the target of the narrator's
artistic (but not romantic) eye. The two of them meet and speak on multiple
occasions but never romantically engage even though a part of the narrator wants
to -- and perhaps a part of Nami wants to, as well.

The book is poetic in nature -- some call it a "haiku novel" -- and doesn't have
much of a plot. The book recounts various happenings on the mountain but is
mainly an exploration of Soseki's philosophical ideas about art.

The opening monologue about life and pain and art is beautiful: "However you
choose to live, the human world is not an easy place to live... You may feel
the human world is a better place, but there is surely no better world to live
in... So if this best of worlds proves a hard one for you, you must simply do
your best to settle in and relax as you can, and make this short life of ours,
if only briefly, an easier place in which to make your home. Herein lies the
poet's true calling, the artist's vocation. We owe our humble gratitude to all
practitioners of the arts, for they mellow the harshness of our human world
and enrich the human heart." This passage, both on its own and in the context
of the rest of the story, has made me reconsider my former apathy toward art:
I now find myself more eager to create, and more appreciative.

I have a lot to say about the topics this passage touches on and will probably
explain in another post, but in the meanwhile: at this point in my life, I agree
that this attitude is part of a sensible approach to pain. Confronting problems
head-on is also essential, but at least in my social circle, rationally
solving problems is assumed to be the only necessary strategy. I suppose the
narrator doesn't mention this since the context of the book implies that he's
outside the realm of rational problem-solving and fully embracing an artistic
existence.

By the way, the narrator's "artistic existence" strikes me as very meditative.
He occasionally describes his attitude as "nonemotional", which I glossed
both as just observant and as not attached. But none of the characters practice
or discuss meditation during the book.

The narrator argues that just observing is a way to practice art. It isn't
creating or doing art in the conventional sense, but to him doing so elevates
one to the realm of the artist.

He also legitimizes "aimless" wandering through his records of his encounters.

The narrator's interest in Nami is unusual: it seems that if he weren't living
in an artistic headspace, he'd be romantically attracted to her. Since he is,
he views her instead as an artistic subject. He's particularly interested in her
statue-like beauty; her hard, chiseled expressions and lack of pity; and her
apparent self-confidence and nonchalance. Several characters tell him that she's
wild and crazy. The old woman's opening poem and the rumors about the death of
Nami's sister add to the perception that Nami is mysterious and perhaps not
afraid of death. It's only at the end, when a sadness passes across her face as
she says goodbye to her brother, that she comes across as fully human and that
the narrator feels he can paint her.

Here are some images I'd like to remember:

- Walking to the guesthouse and observing the skylark and the mustard plants,
  and then assuming a stoic attitude about walking a mile in the rain
- Seeing Nami naked in the bathhouse and comparing her to a Greek statue; being
  struck by her beauty but not on a romantic or sexual level
- Seeing Nami dance back and forth across the field outside the guesthouse and
  reflecting on death as she passes into and out of his field of vision
- Seeing Nami beneath the tree in his dream state on his first night in the
  guesthouse and waking up to different poems than he'd written the night before
- Having tea with Nami's father and his thoughts about the shallowness of
  tea ceremonies
- His discussion of Nami's father's wooden lid and spider inkwell
- The scene by the Mirror Pool, the same one in which Nami's late sister
  supposedly drowned herself; seeing Nami peeking out from above, and seeing the
  many red flowers fall from the trees into the water
- The old woman's story about the girl who was loved by two men who committed
  suicide because of it
- Flipping to a random page in a book and reading with Nami
- Nami giving the bag to her ex-husband
- Everyone traveling in the boat and then to the train to say goodbye to Nami's
  younger brother, who's going off to war
- The phrase "kusamakura" means "grass pillow" and signifies a journey

I'm excited to read more of Natsume Soseki's works, although I'd like to preface
my reading with learning about the context in which Soseki existed: what about
Japan and the Meiji Era compelled him to write?
