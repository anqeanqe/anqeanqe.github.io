The feeling of being at peace; the crispness of the mid-autumn air on a clear day; the excitement of school beginning again; the fluttering of one’s heart when discovering one’s crush.

This feeling is magical. It came a lot as a child, and I associate it most with sweater weather. There’s something about feeling the changing of the seasons but the outside still being comfortable, seeing the leaves change colors and fall to the ground, perking up as the wind blows by. Somehow I experienced this feeling a lot during these moments. Maybe coincidentally; I don’t know.

Part of me thinks this is just the feeling of novelty: having never experienced anything quite like the present. The present yanks you from your thoughts and forces you to enjoy it. But it can’t be so simple, because the feeling is always accompanied by a supreme calmness and confidence, as well as a childlike wonder and curiosity and pure joy. This is a paradigm of experiencing the world that is so different from the humdrum, the monotony, the grind, the daily sameness.

Part of me thinks this feeling is frequent as a child and becomes rarer the older one gets. The more one experiences, the less that is novel, the faster time seems to pass, the fewer fundamentally new experiences one has, the more normal everything begins to feel. This feeling of pure wonder and energy and youth begins to occur less and less often.

This feeling has eluded me for perhaps three years. It visited me again last night and lasted until I fell asleep; when I woke up, it was again gone.

Nothing I have consciously done has ever been able to manufacture the feeling. No drug, no wondrous bout of sex, no intensity of exercise or duration of fasting, no party of close friends has ever deterministically led to this feeling. It is sometimes accompanied by these, but often it is not; it seems to choose when to present itself.

What is this feeling? It cannot be captured simply by the words with which we label various emotions. Even though I have described it here, it is a fundamentally different paradigm of experience; it is subtly different, but also truly different. A different way of experiencing one’s own mind and emotions. Not merely peace or happiness but a different way of experiencing peace and happiness.

What is this feeling? Why is it now so rare? How can I feel it more often? All the time? Is it even possible? Or shall I surrender myself to experiencing it just once again, at random, in five years’ time?

Maybe, like all valuable yet rare experiences which life occasionally gifts us, all that can be done is to recognize the opportunity and to cherish it. I do not know.

I hope that you understand what I mean and have also experienced this feeling.

I want to share this experience and investigate it further.
