At the beginning of one's career, work kinda sucks.  Relative to your more tenured
peers, you have less experience and therefore have less-devloped skills.  You're
mostly learning.  You might be producing, but you're probably producing less
important, less impactful stuff than those who've been around longer.  Plus you're
getting paid probably the least you'll ever get paid.  You might be motivated at
first, but the motivation fades because your career is a long game -- let's say 40
years.  You're not gonna improve noticeably over the course of a week, or a month.
It takes years to improve.

Oh, and you might not even like this career.  You might be totally indifferent to
it, and dealing with a whole bunch of young-adolescent existential-crisis
nihilism.  So you might be even less motivated.

But let's say your company is great, and your trade offers challenge and the
potential for growth.  Gradually, over the course of a few years of showing your
work ethic, commitment to your craft, and maybe loyalty to your company, you
improve.  People start to notice.  You are gradually given more responsibility
and more important work.  People tell you you're doing a good job.  You make
fewer stupid mistakes, and you begin to feel more competent.  You're still low
on the ladder, but you've climbed a rung or two.  Maybe you've even gotten a
promotion and a raise.

You think, "Huh, I didn't like this at the beginning.  But it's been a few years,
and it's better now.  Maybe in a few years I'll like it more, and make more money,
and have more social prestige."  With your new hope and confidence (and, assuming
you haven't dropped out of this industry for other career prospects), you double
down and commit yourself more than you had before.  You're working harder, driving
results faster, wowing people more.  Word's getting around; people really like you,
and they keep complimenting you.  After a few years of this, you've got another
promotion or raise or two, and your feelings of loyalty and confidence and
commitment are strengthened.

And you keep doing this for the next 35 or 30 years.  You live a relatively happy
career, make decent money, and are successful by most Americans' standards.
Awesome!

It's not that simple, of course.  There are potentially many downsides to this
sort of career path.  You might be the kind of person whose ego really likes external
validation, so this external validation feedback loop (where you work
hard, causing you to recieve praise, causing you to work harder, and so on) is a psychological
trap.  You might become fixated on the next title, or the next marginal salary
bump, and the accompanying lifestyle inflation and rise in social status.  And of
course there's a high opportunity cost of staying in one job and at one company:
you're missing out.

The longer the stay, the more attached you become, and thus the more likely you are
to remain; your loyalty grows stronger, even if deep down, you don't _really_
care about the work, company, product, market, etc.  Maybe at first your angst
and dread, at the prospect of a meaningless career spent as a cog in a machine you
don't care about, caused you to think hard about your dream job, and to frequently
try new things.  But maybe this falls away as you become more complacent, as your
job becomes more (superficially) satisfying.  You keep working, and then you retire
and look back and think, "Damn, I spent the majority of my energy during my best
years on making money for companies I didn't really care about.  I kinda enjoyed
it, but man, I'm not proud of it."  You think about how you could have earned
less money and enjoyed less prestige while pursuing something that would have maybe
felt more meaningful -- maybe something more altruistic, or something less
corporate.

Of course, it's impossible to predict what the next 30 years will look like.  These
are concerns, but one's career isn't guaranteed to unfold this way.  There are
other possibilities: for example, as you become more skilled and gain more
experience and respect and money, you have more freedom to work on projects you
think are interesting, and with people you like.  Maybe you can take the occasional
sabbatical.  Maybe your complacence and superficial pleasure with your work and
the direction of your career puts your young, angsty mind at ease, and you have
more bandwidth to "find yourself" with your free time: you take up new hobbies,
meet new people, and gravitate what you really care about.  And now, after a few
years of working, you've got something of a safety net, so you have some more
freedom to maybe give that dream career a shot.  If after a year it fails and you
return to your old career, you'll still be able to retire comfortably.

These aren't the only models for imagining a career, or the only ways to think
about living a meaningful career.  I'm sure some people wouldn't resonate with
these thoughts at all.  Probably some of these considerations have to do with
what specifically you find interesting and maybe worth pursuing, and how much
money you might make on each path, and how much you care about money.  I'd like
to eventually return to this and look at it from different angles.

In any case, these thoughts are part of my personal ongoing narrative, and it's
a work in progress.
