I read "In Praise of Shadows", by Junichiro Tanizaki. Here are some things I'd
like to remember about it:

- Tanizaki prefers Nou performers to Kabuki performers because of their simpler
  looks; they try to not enhance their appearance or seem "sexy," and in his
  opinion they are more realistic and compelling. Lighting affects the way they
  are perceived.
- Beauty of old wooden toilets. There's a quote from Natsume Soseki about
  them: "The novelist Natsume Soseki counted his morning trips to the toilet a
  great pleasure, 'a physiological delight' he called it." Something about
  bathrooms being outside of or separated from the main lodging, requiring
  residents to leave their home in the middle of the night to relieve
  themselves. This is an inconvenience but Tanizaki prefers the nighttime cold
  and the antiquity of the toilets to the modern, overly warm and stuffy
  restrooms.
- Persimmon salmon sushi made with rice and sake. Tanizaki includes a recipe for
  this dish (which sounds delicious) and repeatedly emphasizes ensuring there's
  no excess moisture. One of his several whimsical tangents.
- Alcoves in houses; preferring paper construction (e.g., in shoji and lamp
  shades) because of how it dampens incoming light. Prefers alcoves to be dimly
  lit or not lit at all. The central idea of the book is captured in his
  discussion of alcoves: negative space is valuable.
- The practice of shaving one's eyebrows and blackening one's teeth. I don't
  recall the context(s) in which this occurs but it seems to align with
  Tanizaki's preference for the more solemn, unelevated appearance of Nou
  performers.
- Story about the tour guide who presents a painting which is barely visible
  due to the lighting and the surrounding architecture. Tanizaki delights in
  and praises this.
- Lighting affecting mood at restaurants and the temperature of public (and
  private) spaces. He says that during a summer night he'd rather dim or
  turn off the lights and crack the window instead of keep the lights on
  _and_ turn on the fan, which is both garish and a waste of electricity.
  Basically, lighting affects mood and perception. (E.g., prefers dim
  candles to electric lamps, especially in restaurants.)
- Prefers lacquerware to ceramics, e.g., for serving soup and rice. The
  lacquerware is darker and doesn't absorb the heat of the dish as easily.
  Another instance of aesthetics affecting perception.
- Bit about how Japanese design and architecture choices were influenced by
  the West having developed earlier than the East, and the East then feeling
  the need to catch up (i.e., mimic) as quickly as possible. Tanizaki postulates
  that had Japan developed the technologies first or not been introduced to the
  West, they would have been able to lead with form rather than function. E.g.,
  they would have been able to design ovens that functioned as well as Western
  ovens but which appealed to the Eastern aesthetic sense.
- Story about Einstein visiting Japan, seeing signs with neon lights, and
  remarking on how wasteful they are. Tanizaki believes Japan wastes a lot of
  electricity and energy, and he is sad about this.
- The quote about elegance being frigid: "If indeed "elegance is frigid," it
  can as well be described as filthy. There is no denying, at any rate, that
  among the elements of the elegance in which we take such delight is a measure
  of the unclean, the unsanitary." This helps explain his somewhat afunctional
  preference for darkness and coldness.
- Tanizaki's style is very wandering. The book has no clear organization; it
  reads as a stream of consciousness. On the one hand, his attitude is very
  orderly, conservative, atechnical, and opposed to change; but on the other,
  his romantic, form-before-function sensibilities align well with the book's
  lack of structure.
- The general feeling is that darkness evokes a sense of mystery and unknowing,
  necessitates care and gentleness, and prompts thoughts about what could be
  or what is not, instead of just what is. Darkness obscures one's senses, but
  in doing so, it heightens them, out of necessity. It has the power to make one
  more present and aware. This attitude strikes me as meditative.

"In Praise of Shadows" was first published in 1977. I wonder how pervasive
Tanizaki's attitude was back then and how pervasive it is now, and what the
competing sets of values and beliefs are. I can see the case being made that
Tanizaki's perspective, if widely embraced in Japan, could limit Japan's
technological growth. I also wonder if there exist people who oppose his
nostalgia because old aesthetics remind them too much of the colonial period and
the wars. And I wonder whether books like this risk fetishizing or commoditizing
this older aesthetic style in the eyes of outsiders, thereby tarnishing the
ideas they hope to protect.

Perhaps my most important takeaway is that aesthetics are tied to values. Values
inform aesthetic preferences and aesthetic preferences inform values. My belief
before reading this book was that aesthetics were largely superficial and
untethered from beliefs -- but this is, of course, just a belief about
aesthetics, informed by my own Western experiences. And reading this book has
made me come to disagree with my former stance: I am beginning to put more
thought into how my surroundings look, and I am happier for doing so.

Overall, this is a romantically inspiring and pleasantly quick read.
